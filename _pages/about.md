I'm Lam "Nathan" Nguyen, a Master student from the Department of [Computer Science at CWRU](). Previously, I graduated Cum Laude Bachelor from [Computer Science at CWRU]().

I am interested in *Language Models*, *Knowledge Engineering*, and *Efficient ML*. I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Yinghui Wu](https://yinghwu.github.io) and [Xiaotian Han](https://ahxt.github.io).

My research focuses on bridging *Language Models* and *Knowledge Graphs* to enable efficient reasoning and structured knowledge discovery. Iâ€™m particularly passionate about designing **inference-efficient systems** that fuse symbolic and neural methods, with applications to downstream tasks such as ontology alignment, text-to-query generation, and multi-agent reasoning. I also explore optimization strategies, such as **post-training quantization**, to further accelerate and scale these language models.

Feel free to reach out at [ltn18 at case dot edu](mailto:ltn18@case.edu) if you are inerested in connecting or exploring potential collaborations.
