I'm Lam "Nathan" Nguyen, a Master student from the Department of [Computer Science at CWRU]().

I am fortunate to be advised by talented Professors [Yinghui Wu](https://yinghwu.github.io) and [Xiaotian Han](https://ahxt.github.io), supported by [MDS3 Research Fellowship](https://mds3-coe.com/students/). 

My research focuses on *Large Language Models* and *Knowledge Retrieval*.

Prior to grad school, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon and Microsoft.

Feel free to reach out at [lamng3 dot work at gmail dot com](mailto:lamng3.work@gmail.com) if you are interested in connecting or exploring potential collaborations.
